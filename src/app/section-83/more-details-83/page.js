			<h2>Section 83 of the IPC</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>What is the law about?</strong>
				<br />
				<li>
					Section 83 states:{" "}
					<i>
						"Nothing is an offence which is done by a child above seven years of
						age and under twelve, who has not attained sufficient maturity of
						understanding to judge the nature and consequences of his conduct."
					</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					This section provides qualified immunity for children aged between
					seven and twelve. It means that children in this age group are
					presumed to have partial capacity to commit crimes, but only if they
					are proven to have the maturity and understanding to know the nature
					and consequences of their actions.
				</li>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Why was it imposed?</strong>
				<br />
				<li>
					The law recognizes that children between the ages of seven and twelve
					are at a developmental stage where they are capable of forming some
					level of understanding but may not always comprehend the gravity or
					consequences of their actions.
				</li>
				<li>
					The purpose of this law is to allow the court discretion in
					determining whether the child had sufficient mental maturity at the
					time of the crime. If the child is found to be sufficiently mature,
					they can be held accountable. However, if it is proven that the child
					lacked the capacity to understand the criminal nature of their act,
					they cannot be punished.
				</li>
				<li>
					This law reflects the principle of proportional responsibility,
					meaning a childâ€™s maturity is taken into account before assigning
					criminal liability.
				</li>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>What is the punishment?</strong>
				<br />
				<li>
					If the court determines that the child does not possess the required
					level of maturity to understand the crime, the child will not be held
					criminally liable, and there will be no punishment.
				</li>
				<li>
					If the court finds that the child had sufficient understanding of
					their actions, the child may be subjected to a lesser form of
					punishment than an adult would receive for the same offense, taking
					into account their age and mental development.
				</li>
