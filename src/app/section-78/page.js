				<strong>What is the law about?</strong>
				<br />
				Section 78 states:{" "}
				<i>
					"Nothing done in pursuance of, or which is warranted by, the judgment
					or order of a court of justice is an offense, provided such judgment
					or order remains in force, even if the court lacked jurisdiction to
					pass such judgment or order. This applies as long as the person acting
					does so in good faith, believing that the court had such
					jurisdiction."
				</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Why was it imposed?</strong>
				<br />
				"This provision was imposed to ensure that individuals who carry out
				orders issued by a court of law are not held criminally liable, even if
				the court's order is later found to be incorrect or without
				jurisdiction. This section is crucial for maintaining the authority and
				respect of the judicial system. It protects individuals from potential
				criminal charges when they act in good faith, believing the court order
				to be valid and lawful."{" "}
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>What is the punishment?</strong>
				<br /> "As per this provision, no punishment is applicable to a person
				who acts in good faith pursuant to a court order, even if the court
				order is later found to be invalid or issued without jurisdiction. This
				section provides immunity to such individuals."
