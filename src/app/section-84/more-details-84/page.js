			<h2>Section 84 of the IPC</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>1. What is the law about?</strong>
				<li>
					Section 84 states: "Nothing is an offence which is done by a person
					who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is
					incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what
					is either wrong or contrary to law."{" "}
				</li>
				<li>
					This section provides a complete defense for persons suffering from
					unsoundness of mind (i.e., mental illness or cognitive disorders) at
					the time of committing the offense. It ensures that such individuals
					are not held criminally liable for acts they are mentally incapable of
					understanding.{" "}
				</li>
				<li>
					In legal terms, this is referred to as the insanity defense. If a
					person cannot understand what they are doing or that what they are
					doing is wrong or illegal due to mental incapacity, they cannot be
					punished for that act.
				</li>
			</p>
			<p>
				{" "}
				<strong>2. Why was it imposed? </strong>
				<li>
					The rationale behind this law is that criminal responsibility hinges
					on a person’s ability to understand their actions and appreciate the
					consequences. If an individual’s mental condition prevents them from
					understanding the nature of the act or distinguishing between right
					and wrong, it would be unjust to hold them criminally responsible.
				</li>{" "}
				<li>
					This law was imposed to ensure that justice is humane and equitable.
					It acknowledges that persons of unsound mind cannot be treated like
					normal offenders as they lack the requisite mental capacity to form
					criminal intent (mens rea).
				</li>
				<li>
					{" "}
					The section aligns with the broader principles of fairness and
					compassion in legal systems worldwide, ensuring that mentally ill
					individuals are not wrongfully punished for actions they do not fully
					comprehend.{" "}
				</li>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>3. What is the punishment? </strong>
				<li>
					Individuals who successfully prove that they were of unsound mind at
					the time of committing the offense are not subject to criminal
					punishment under Section 84.
				</li>
				<li>
					However, they may be detained in a mental health facility or undergo
					treatment in a secure environment if they are considered a danger to
					society or themselves. This is done not as a punishment, but to ensure
					their well-being and the safety of others.
				</li>
