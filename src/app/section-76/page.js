			<h2>Section 76 of the IPC</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>What is the law about?</strong>
				<br />
				Section 76 states:{" "}
				<i>
					"Nothing is an offense if it is done by a person who, due to a mistake
					of fact, and in good faith, believes themselves to be bound by law to
					do it."
				</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Why was it imposed?</strong>
				<br />
				"It was imposed to establish a principle of justice and fairness. It
				recognizes that individuals may sometimes act under the honest belief
				that they are legally obligated to do so, even if that belief turns out
				to be incorrect. In such cases, it would be unjust to punish them for
				actions taken in good faith."{" "}
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>What is the punishment?</strong>
				<br /> "Punishment is typically imposed for committing a crime or
				offense. It can take various forms, including: Imprisonment: Confinement
				in a jail or prison. Fines: Monetary penalties. Community Service:
				Unpaid work performed for the public good. Probation: Supervision by a
				probation officer. Death Penalty: In some jurisdictions, capital
				punishment.
