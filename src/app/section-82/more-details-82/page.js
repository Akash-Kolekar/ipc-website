			<h2>Section 82 of the IPC</h2>

			<strong>What is the law about?</strong>
			<br />
			<li>
				Section 82 states:{" "}
				<i>
					"Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under seven years of
					age."
				</i>
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				This provision establishes absolute immunity from criminal prosecution
				for any child below the age of seven. In simpler terms, any act or
				omission by a child under seven years, regardless of the nature of the
				act, will not be considered a crime under Indian law.
			</li>

			<p>
				<strong>Why was it imposed?</strong>
				<br />
				<li>
					The law is based on the principle of "doli incapax," which means a
					child is presumed incapable of forming criminal intent. This
					presumption holds that children under seven years do not have the
					necessary mental development or understanding to differentiate between
					right and wrong or to comprehend the consequences of their actions.
				</li>{" "}
				<br />
				<li>
					Children at such a young age lack the mens rea (guilty mind) required
					to commit an offense, which is why the law provides them full
					protection from criminal liability. This aligns with modern
					psychological and child development theories.
				</li>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>What is the punishment?</strong>
				<br />
				<li>
					There is no punishment under this section. The child below seven years
					is completely immune from prosecution, meaning they cannot be tried or
					punished for any act they commit.
				</li>
			</p>
