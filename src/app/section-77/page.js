			<p>
				<strong>What is the law about?</strong>
				<br />
				Section 77 states:{" "}
				<i>
					"Nothing is an offense if it is done by a judge acting judicially in
					the exercise of any power which, in good faith, they believe to be
					granted to them by law."
				</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Why was it imposed?</strong>
				<br />
				"It was imposed to protect judges and judicial officers from criminal
				liability for actions taken in their official capacity. It recognizes
				that judges often make difficult decisions that may have legal and
				social implications. To ensure judicial independence and encourage
				fearless decision-making, this provision grants immunity to judges for
				actions taken in good faith, even if those actions later prove to be
				erroneous."{" "}
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>What is the punishment?</strong>
				<br /> "No punishment is applicable to a judge acting judicially. This
				provision essentially grants immunity to judges, shielding them from
				criminal prosecution for actions taken within their judicial capacity."
			</p>
