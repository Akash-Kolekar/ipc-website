			<h2>Section 74 of the IPC</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>What is the law about?</strong>
				<br />
				Section 74 states:{" "}
				<i>
					"It ensures that the punishment is not excessively harsh by setting
					additional restrictions on how long solitary confinement can last
					within the given timeframe."
				</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Why was it imposed?</strong>
				<br />
				This restriction aims to mitigate the potentially harmful psychological
				and physical effects of prolonged isolation.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>What is the punishment?</strong>
				<br /> These section deo not themselves specify a punishment for
				breaking the provisions outlined within them. Instead, these section
				regulates how solitary confinement can be imposed as a part of a
				court-ordered punishment for other offences.
